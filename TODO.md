# TODO for Adding Quantity to Transactions

- [x] Update borrow/route.ts: Accept quantity input, validate against available quantity using sum of quantities, set quantity in transaction.
- [x] Update return/route.ts: Accept quantity input, validate against net borrows, set quantity in transaction.
- [ ] Test the endpoints to ensure quantity is handled correctly.
